# Concurrency-Puzzles
Implementations of potential solutions to various synchronization/concurrency puzzles taken from The Little Book of Semaphores by Allen B. Downey

Each problem has 2 potential implemented solutions in either the C language using POSIX pthreads or the Java language using an extension of the Thread class.

Each problem allows the user to specify the number of threads to execute in parallel along with their characteristics which must be provided in an input file. Each problem has 2 different test files to use as demonstrations. Some problems require additional parameters to be specified at program execution. 

IMPORTANT: C programs will require comma separated value files, Java programs will require space separated value files.

A description of problems chosen along with input requirements follows:
